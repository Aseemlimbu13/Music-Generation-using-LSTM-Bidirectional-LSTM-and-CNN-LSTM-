# Music-Generation-using-LSTM-Bidirectional-LSTM-and-CNN-LSTM-
This project aims to explore the fascinating world of music generation using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, and Convolutional Neural Networks combined with LSTM (CNN+LSTM), we delve into the realm of algorithmic music composition.

The project follows a comprehensive approach, incorporating all the conventional steps of machine learning. From data preprocessing to model development and evaluation, every aspect is meticulously implemented to ensure the creation of musical notes.
